// TODO
// The idea is to generate random lineups and have them play multiple games against them.
// The ultimate goal is to figure out the most valuable players/lineups.
// There are a lot of things to factor and also need to decide how complex the simulation should be.
// We will need to devise simple basic strategy rules and might want to create certain lineup "types."
// Players could be grouped into tiers. Could also weight the amount of points spent hitters/sp/rp
// Will have to exclude strategy cards for any forseeable future.
// Will need to improve simulation to handle defense and baserunning.
